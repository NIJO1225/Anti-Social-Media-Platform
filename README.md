### Project Description
Anti-Social Media is a unique coding project that reimagines the way we interact online by flipping the norms of traditional social media.Designed as a pushback against the constant pursuit of likes,shares, and validation, this platform emphasizes ephemeral content that vanishes once acknowledged. The goal is to create a space where users post without expecting feedback, and any interaction leads to the content disappearing

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Helping users avoid the dread of too much validation and ensuring that if someone dares to acknowledge a post, it disappears forever.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
This problem is solved with a twist: if someone dares to like your post, poof--it's gone! Now, users won't fry their brains stressing over likes and popularity.
